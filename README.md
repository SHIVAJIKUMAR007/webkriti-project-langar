# webkriti-project-langar
Langar is a food delivery website, made for webkriti (The contest organized by AASF ABV-IIITM GWALIOR).

As it is said it is a online food delivery website, it took order from the customer and give the order to the restaurant. The restaurant send the delivery boy with the order.

Here the intersting quetion arise that that how the delivery boy know that he is delivering to the right customer, for that there is a OTP 
which is recieved by the customer on ordering anything. First the delivery boy take OTP and verify it by submit that OTP in the owner page where he recieved the order. If the OTP varified means he reached to the right customer.

In our website customer not only oreder, he can rate us also and he can also mail us to solve his query.
If customer is not satisfied with us than he may also massage us from facebook, twitter, whatsapp, and linkedin. He may follow us on these digital platforms by simply go to our contact us page and clicking the icon by which he prefer.

there is also a loophole that you cann't order form two diffrent reataurant in a single order, but it is also nessesary from the website manager point of view. Beacause if it happen than there will arise many problem which the website manager have to face. like : distribution of money and delivery boy also have to travel to more etc.

here is some of the screenshot of our website.
